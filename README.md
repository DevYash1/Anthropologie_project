Some Information about "ANTHROPOLOGIE"

Anthropologie was founded by current URBN chairman and president Dick Hayne, having heard the plea of a friend. She had just moved to the suburbs of Philadelphia,
and was dissatisfied with the shopping options available to her. Now a distance from Urban Outfitters—a brand she also was aging out of—there was a void in her life.
She longed for a store to indulgeher creative side. Dick, realizing this wasn't an isolated phenomenon, went on to build a lifestyle brand that catered to creative,
educated and affluent 30-45 year-old women. Named after his college major (but with a decidedly French twist), Anthropologie opened its very first doors in the autumn of
1992 in Wayne, Pennsylvania. We now operate over 200 stores worldwide.

This is information of orignal ANTHROPOLOGIE  website so basically this is an E-commerce website in this website we can purchase various products like Beauty Products , Dresses , Women Clothes,
Furniture and more ... we tried our best to clone this website in 3 days.
